# Effective SSH usage for Pentesters

This is a beginner level session to train you into using `SSH` more effectively. 

While pentesters may benefit (especially if they are planning on doing a time based exam like OSCP), this should be useful for anyone who has a need to login to servers using a `Secure SHell`.
